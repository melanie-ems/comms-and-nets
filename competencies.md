This topic is about the exchange of data between devices, commonly referred to as nodes.


# Communication

## Communication Methods

- Define serial and parallel transmission methods and discuss the advantages of serial over parallel transmission.
- Define and compare synchronous and asynchronous data transmission.
- Describe the purpose of start and stop bits in asynchronous data transmission.

## Communication Basics

Define:
- baud rate
- bit rate
- bandwidth
- latency
- protocol

- Differentiate between baud rate and bit rate.
- Understand the relationship between bit rate and bandwidth.

# Networking

## Topology

Understand:
- physical star topology
- logical bus network topology

And:
- differentiate between them
- explain their operation

## Networking between Hosts

Explain the following and describe situations where they might be used:
- peer-to-peer networking
- client-server networking

## Explain the purpose of WiFi
